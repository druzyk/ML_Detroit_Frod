    "### Задание – предсказание оплаты выставленных штрафов.\n",
    "Мэрия некоего города пытается бороться с ненадлежащим содержанием владельцами своих домохозяйств с помощью штрафов. Каждый год мэрия выставляет штрафы на миллионы долларов, но многие из них остаются неоплаченными. Так как принудительное взимание штрафа – долгий и дорогой процесс, мэрия хотела бы улучшить процесс взимания штрафов.\n",
    "Первым шагом в этом улучшении может стать понимание того, почему домовладелец может отказаться оплатить штраф. Для ответа на этот вопрос можно построить предиктивную модель оплаты штрафа. \n",
    "Задание: построить модель, предсказывающую, будет ли штраф оплачен вовремя. \n",
    "Данные представлены двумя файлами - train.csv для обучения модели и test.csv – для валидации модели. Каждая запись в этих файлах относится к одному выставленному штрафу и содержит информацию о том когда, кому и за что был выписан штраф. Целевая переменная compliance содержится только в тренировочном наборе. Эта переменная имеет значение True, если штраф был оплачен вовремя, т.е. в течение месяца после выставления, False – если был оплачен после этого срока или не оплачен вообще и Null, если штраф был выписан ошибочно.  \n",
    "Замечание: ошибочно выписанные штрафы не следует использовать для обучения модели. Они включены в тренировочный набор исключительно как дополнительный источник данных для визуализации данных или для кластеризации исходных данных (если понадобится). \n",
    "\n",
    "Описание файлов:\n",
    "* Train_2.csv – тренировочный набор (все штрафы выписанные в 2004-2011)\n",
    "* Test_2.csv – тестовый набор (все штрафы выписанные в 2012-2016)\n",
